# Kaggle Inclass Competition "Alice"

In the 1st  [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/catch-me-if-you-can-intruder-detection-through-webpage-session-tracking2) you''ll be solving the task of user identification tracking his/her sequence of visited websites.

- if you overfitted and dropped several paces down on private LB, no offense, it's life, only private LB is used to calculate credits
- Up to December 18, those who managed to beat all benchmarks should upload their reproducible solutions in the .py format (python script) [here](https://www.dropbox.com/request/hhY96sNGMpphOf4oXC8r)
