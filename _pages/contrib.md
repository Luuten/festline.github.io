Fire is kept by enthusiasts. You can foster the development of [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai) in various ways. 

### Edit materials
If you notice a typo in materials, you are welcome to open an [Issue](https://github.com/Yorko/mlcourse.ai/issues) in the course repo or to send a pull request. If you'd like to join the course team to work on materials, please contact Yury via Slack (@yorko). 

### Spread a word
Well, this never hurts. LinkedIn/Facebook/Reddit - wherever you share your impressions about the course, you've done a good deed. 

### Financial support
Our course is not a commercial activity, and it's offered for free. However, organizing this all is not always fun. So we have to invest in such activities as maintaining student rating, proofreading materials, keeping this site alive etc. You are cordially welcome to support us on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ods_mlcourse), especially if you found this course helpful in boosting your DS career.
