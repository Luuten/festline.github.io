[mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai) is an open Machine Learning course by OpenDataScience. The course is designed to perfectly balance theory and practice; therefore, each topic is followed by an assignment with a deadline in a week. You can also take part in several Kaggle Inclass competitions held during the course.

The next session is planned to launch on **February 11, 2019**. Fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BMqcUc-hIQXa0HB_Q2Oa8vWBtGHXk8a6xo5gPnMKYKA/edit) to participate. Wait for more details in the end of January.
