[mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai) is an open Machine Learning course by OpenDataScience. The course is designed to perfectly balance theory and practice; therefore, each topic is followed by an assignment with a deadline in a week. You can also take part in several Kaggle Inclass competitions held during the course.

The next session is planned to launch on **February 2019**. Please wait for an announcement in January.
