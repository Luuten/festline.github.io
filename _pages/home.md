[mlcourse.ai](mlcourse.ai) is an open Machine Learning course by OpenDataScience. The course is designed to perfectly balance theory and practice; therefore, each topic is followed by an assignment with a deadline in a week. You can also take part in several Kaggle Inclass competitions held during the course and do your own projects.

Next session starts on October 1, 2018. Fill in [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_pDNuVHwBxV5wuOcdaXoxBZneyAQcqfOl4V2qkqKbNQ/) to participate.
